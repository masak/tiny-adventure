A tiny adventure game, implemented in various languages for practice.

Here's an example session:

    ## hallway

    This room feels very welcoming, with warm colors and a friendly atmosphere.
    There's a big huge door to the south, that beckons for you to open it.
    Exits are east.

    > east

    ## kitchen

    All neat and clean surfaces. Clearly this kitchen is tended by a professional.

    There is a key here.
    Exits are west.

    > take key

    You pick up the key.

    > west

    ## hallway

    > open door

    You unlock the door with the key.
    You open the door. There's now a new exit to the south.

    > douth

    Unknown command; sorry.

    > south

    You win the game. Thanks for playing!
